ros-indigo-swri-image-util (0.0.10-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Update contrast stretch nodelet to automatically scale image mask to correct size.
  * Fixed compile error when ros-indigo-opencv3 is installed (#307 <https://github.com/evenator/marti_common/issues/307>)
    * Fixed compile error when package ros-indigo-opencv3 is installed.
    swri_geometry_util uses wrong version of OpenCV when the package
    ros-indigo-opencv3 is installed. This patch fixes the issue.
    * Updated all CMakeFiles.txt to specify OpenCV version 2
    The find_package for OpenCV is now:
    ./swri_opencv_util/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(OpenCV 2 REQUIRED)
    ./swri_geometry_util/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(OpenCV 2 REQUIRED)
    ./swri_image_util/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(OpenCV 2)
    ./swri_transform_util/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(OpenCV 2 REQUIRED)
