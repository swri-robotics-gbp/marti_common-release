ros-indigo-swri-opencv-util (0.0.10-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Fixed compile error when ros-indigo-opencv3 is installed (#307 <https://github.com/evenator/marti_common/issues/307>)
    * Fixed compile error when package ros-indigo-opencv3 is installed.
    swri_geometry_util uses wrong version of OpenCV when the package
    ros-indigo-opencv3 is installed. This patch fixes the issue.
    * Updated all CMakeFiles.txt to specify OpenCV version 2
    The find_package for OpenCV is now:
    ./swri_opencv_util/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(OpenCV 2 REQUIRED)
    ./swri_geometry_util/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(OpenCV 2 REQUIRED)
    ./swri_image_util/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(OpenCV 2)
    ./swri_transform_util/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(OpenCV 2 REQUIRED)

  * Marks some constructors explicit.
  * Refactors RANSAC matching code to use more matrix operations.
  * Fixes bugs in FitRigidTransform2d.
    The main problem was that reshape was being used incorrectly, causing the
    points to get shuffled around.  Once that was fixed, it was clear that
    the rotation should not be inverted.  Also adds a comment to clarify
    the significance of the returned transform.
