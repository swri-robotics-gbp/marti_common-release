ros-indigo-swri-transform-util (0.0.10-1saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Add great circle distance method for tf::Vector3 type.
  * Fixed compile error when ros-indigo-opencv3 is installed (#307 <https://github.com/evenator/marti_common/issues/307>)
    * Fixed compile error when package ros-indigo-opencv3 is installed.
    swri_geometry_util uses wrong version of OpenCV when the package
    ros-indigo-opencv3 is installed. This patch fixes the issue.
    * Updated all CMakeFiles.txt to specify OpenCV version 2
    The find_package for OpenCV is now:
    ./swri_opencv_util/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(OpenCV 2 REQUIRED)
    ./swri_geometry_util/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(OpenCV 2 REQUIRED)
    ./swri_image_util/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(OpenCV 2)
    ./swri_transform_util/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(OpenCV 2 REQUIRED)

ros-indigo-swri-transform-util (0.0.9-1saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Fixes initialize_origin.py diagnostic reporting a warning that the
    origin is not automatic when it is.
  * Adds transform publisher to initialize_origin.py that publishes an
    identity transform from the local_xy_frame to an anonymous unused
    frame.  In doing so, the local_xy_frame will show up
    in the /tf tree without any additional nodes running so that
    TransformManager can properly transform between /wgs84 and /map.
    This change should not interfere with any existing systems.
  * Expands some of the TransformManager warnings to be more
    informative.  This is to reduce the impact of common problems that we
    run into when setting up a new environment by making it easier to
    distinguish the exact nature of the error, as well as provide
    suggestions when appropriate.
    In particular, this fixes the misleading
    "No transfomer from /wgs84 to /map" error and upgrades a warning
    about null pointers to an error.

ros-indigo-swri-transform-util (0.0.8-1saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Accounts for non-zero reference angles when calculating orientations to and from WGS84.
  * Publishes origin with east orientation (0 yaw) by default.
  * Supports arbitrary local_xy reference angles.
    * The reference heading is renamed to reference angle.
    * It's not recommended to set a non-zero reference angle.
    * Adds a parameter to ignore the reference heading for backwards compatibility.
  * Fixes backwards compatibility issue with swri_yaml_cpp call.
